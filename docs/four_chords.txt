Generate a 16 measure loop of four chords (I, IV, vi, V) in given key.

Arguments:
  key:      Root note of the desired key, a-g using 'b' for flats or sharps.
  waveform: Type of waveform to generate, one of:
              - pulse
              - sawtooth
              - sine
              - square
              - triangle
  bpm:      Desired tempo in beats per minute, in range 1-300.
  volume:   Loudness of generated waveform, from 1-11.

The name of the generated wav file is determined by the waveform and key. 
For example 'pulse-eb-four-chords.wav'
