Generate a wav file of a single note waveform.

Arguments
  waveform: Type of waveform to generate, one of:
              - pulse
              - sawtooth
              - sine
              - square
              - triangle
  note:     Note in lowercase, from c0 to b8, use 'b' for flats.
  seconds:  Length of generated waveform, from 1-60.
  volume:   Loudness of generated waveform, from 1-11.

  The name of the generated wav file is determined by the waveform and note
  arguments, e.g. 'd2-triangle.wav'.
