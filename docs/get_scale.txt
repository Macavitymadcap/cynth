              - square
              - triangle
  tonic:    The scale's root note. Lowercase from c0 to b8, use 'b' for flats.

              - major
              - natural-minor
              - harmonic-minor

  bpm:      Desired tempo in beats per minute, in range 1-300.

The name of the generated wav file is determined by the waveform, tonic and
scale. For example 'sine-c4-major.wav'
